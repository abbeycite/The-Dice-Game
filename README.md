# The-Dice-Game
The dice game that uses the random randint modules.
a global variable named "high_score" has been declared right after defining a function for dicegame():
Within a "while loop", we receive an input with "value" via the input function prompt.
Player pick the dice game when they enter 1 as an input or 2 to leave the game.
when he/she enter 1, he rolls dice twice and get assigned random numbers between 1 - 6.
Get the sum of the twice values from the rolled dice and compared with the high_score declared earlier.
If the total from the two rolls is greater the high_score then a new high score is set.
Finally if player enter 2, then game terminates and leave game.
Similarly, if player input number other than 1 or 2, then "Invalid input" is returned.
